2024-09-17 14:13:13,738 - research_agent_logger - INFO - Improve advice: 
 The last trial of the improved MOBIL model did not meet the performance requirements, showing only a marginal improvement over the baseline model with an improved rate of 1.23%. The evaluation metrics (Precision, Recall, F1, Specificity) also show only slight improvements, which are insufficient for a significant performance enhancement.

**Analysis of Current Model Limitations:**
1. **Communication Delays and Errors:** The model incorporated stochastic variables to account for communication delays and errors, but it seems these additions were not sufficient to handle real-world uncertainties effectively. The stochastic modeling might not have captured the variability accurately or the parameters used were not representative of actual conditions.

2. **Interaction Modeling:** While the model extended to consider multiple vehicles, the weighted sum of their accelerations and the dynamic adjustment of the politeness factor might not have been calibrated effectively. The interactions could be overly simplified or the weights assigned to different vehicles' accelerations might not reflect their actual impact on the decision-making process.

3. **Game Theory and Cooperation Mechanisms:** The use of game theory and cooperation mechanisms are complex and require precise definitions and implementations. The current model might not have effectively captured the strategic interactions among drivers or the lane change negotiations.

**Suggestions for Further Improvement:**
1. **Refinement of Stochastic Modeling:** Enhance the modeling of communication delays and errors by using more sophisticated probabilistic models that better capture the uncertainties in vehicular communication systems. Consider using different distributions or more dynamic models that adjust based on real-time data.

2. **Advanced Interaction Dynamics:** Improve the interaction model by incorporating more detailed and realistic vehicle dynamics and driver behaviors. Use a more complex weighting system that can dynamically adjust based on various traffic conditions and individual driver profiles.

3. **Detailed Game Theoretical Approach:** Refine the game theoretical model by defining more precise utility functions for each driver, considering multiple strategies drivers might adopt, and using more comprehensive data to validate these strategies. This could lead to a better simulation of cooperative behaviors and strategic decision-making in lane-changing.

4. **Complex Conflict Resolution Algorithms:** Develop more advanced algorithms for conflict resolution that can handle high-density traffic scenarios and multiple lane changes occurring simultaneously. These algorithms should be capable of predicting potential conflicts and proposing optimal resolutions based on real-time traffic data and driver behavior predictions.

By focusing on these areas, the model can be enhanced to better simulate real-world driving environments and improve decision-making accuracy in lane-changing scenarios.

 The analysis of the last trial indicates that while the improved MOBIL model showed a marginal improvement over the baseline, it still did not meet the desired performance requirements. The primary reasons and suggestions for further enhancement are as follows:

### Reasons for Low Performance:
1. **Complexity in Interaction Modeling**: The extension to consider multiple vehicles and dynamic adjustments of the politeness factor may not have been effectively calibrated, leading to an oversimplification of real-world interactions and impacts on decision-making.
2. **Stochastic Modeling of Communication Delays and Errors**: The model's approach to handling communication uncertainties might not have accurately captured the variability and dynamics of real-world conditions.
3. **Game Theory and Cooperation Mechanisms**: Implementing game theory for strategic interactions and cooperation might have been too rudimentary or inaccurately modeled, failing to capture the nuanced behaviors of drivers in diverse traffic scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Enhanced Stochastic Models**: Adopt more sophisticated probabilistic models that dynamically adjust based on real-time data. This could involve using Bayesian networks or Markov models that can better represent the uncertainties and variabilities in vehicular communications.
2. **Refined Interaction Dynamics**: Improve the weighting system in the interaction model to reflect more realistic vehicle dynamics and driver behaviors. This could involve using non-linear weighting functions that adjust based on the specific traffic conditions and historical data patterns.
3. **Advanced Game Theoretical Models**: Develop a more detailed game-theoretical framework that includes comprehensive and realistic utility functions for each driver. This should also consider various strategic options that drivers might adopt, validated against extensive real-world driving data.
4. **Complex Conflict Resolution Algorithms**: Implement algorithms capable of managing high-density traffic scenarios and resolving multiple simultaneous lane changes. These algorithms should use predictive analytics to foresee potential conflicts and suggest optimal maneuvers based on current and predicted traffic conditions.

By focusing on these areas, the model can potentially offer a more accurate and realistic simulation of driver behavior and vehicle interactions in lane-changing scenarios, leading to better decision-making and enhanced traffic flow and safety.

 To further refine the model's performance in automated vehicle lane-changing and traffic management, consider the following enhancements:

1. **Advanced Stochastic Models**: Integrate non-geometrical stochastic models (NGSM) and Stochastic Model Predictive Decision-Making (SMPDM) to better handle communication uncertainties and improve the reliability of vehicular communications. This approach will allow the model to dynamically adjust to real-time data and uncertainties more effectively.

2. **Refined Interaction Dynamics**: Implement hybrid reinforcement learning frameworks combined with social value orientation (SVO) models to enhance the interaction dynamics between vehicles. This approach will enable a more nuanced understanding and simulation of vehicle interactions based on a combination of learned behaviors and predefined social behaviors.

3. **Enhanced Game Theoretical Models**: Utilize a combination of cooperative and non-cooperative game theory models, integrated with V2X technology, to improve strategic interactions and cooperation among vehicles. This will allow for a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of driver behaviors in diverse traffic scenarios, enhancing decision-making and cooperation.

4. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Incorporate insights from physics, statistics, and operations research to enhance the mathematical and theoretical foundations of the models. This could involve exploring simpler mathematical formulations that maintain accuracy without increasing computational complexity, as well as enhancing the robustness and adaptability of the models to different traffic scenarios.

These refined proposals should be validated through extensive simulation studies and real-world testing to ensure their effectiveness in improving traffic flow and safety in scenarios involving automated vehicles.

 The last trial of the improved MOBIL model, while showing some improvement over the baseline, still fell short of meeting performance requirements. Here��s a focused analysis and suggestions for further enhancement based on the provided log.

### Analysis of Current Model Limitations:
1. **Complex Interaction Modeling**: The model's extension to consider multiple vehicles and dynamic adjustments of politeness may not have been effectively calibrated. This could lead to an oversimplification or inaccurate representation of real-world interactions, impacting decision-making accuracy.
   
2. **Stochastic Modeling of Communication Delays and Errors**: The approach to handling communication uncertainties might not have accurately captured the variability and dynamics of real-world conditions, potentially leading to suboptimal decision-making in lane-changing scenarios.

3. **Game Theory and Cooperation Mechanisms**: The implementation of game theory for strategic interactions and cooperation might have been too rudimentary or inaccurately modeled, failing to capture the nuanced behaviors of drivers in diverse traffic scenarios.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Enhanced Stochastic Models**: Adopt more sophisticated probabilistic models that dynamically adjust based on real-time data. This could involve using Bayesian networks or Markov models that better represent the uncertainties and variabilities in vehicular communications.

2. **Refined Interaction Dynamics**: Improve the weighting system in the interaction model to reflect more realistic vehicle dynamics and driver behaviors. This could involve using non-linear weighting functions that adjust based on specific traffic conditions and historical data patterns.

3. **Advanced Game Theoretical Models**: Develop a more detailed game-theoretical framework that includes comprehensive and realistic utility functions for each driver. This should also consider various strategic options that drivers might adopt, validated against extensive real-world driving data.

4. **Complex Conflict Resolution Algorithms**: Implement algorithms capable of managing high-density traffic scenarios and resolving multiple simultaneous lane changes. These algorithms should use predictive analytics to foresee potential conflicts and suggest optimal maneuvers based on current and predicted traffic conditions.

By focusing on these areas, the model can potentially offer a more accurate and realistic simulation of driver behavior and vehicle interactions in lane-changing scenarios, leading to better decision-making and enhanced traffic flow and safety.

 **Analysis of Low Performance:**

The refined MOBIL model showed some improvement over the baseline but still did not meet the desired performance benchmarks. Several factors could be contributing to this underperformance:

1. **Complexity in Interaction Modeling**: The model's complexity in handling multiple vehicle interactions and dynamic adjustments may not fully capture the real-world driving environment's intricacies. This could lead to inaccuracies in predicting driver behavior and vehicle dynamics during lane changes.

2. **Handling of Stochastic Elements**: The model's approach to incorporating stochastic elements like communication uncertainties and driver behavior variability may not be sufficiently robust. This could result in less reliable decision-making under varying traffic conditions.

3. **Game Theoretical Aspects**: While the model attempts to integrate game theory for strategic interactions, it may not effectively simulate the competitive and cooperative behaviors observed among drivers, which are crucial for realistic traffic simulations.

4. **Safety Criteria and Incentive Calculations**: The model's safety criteria and incentive calculations for lane changes might be too rigid or simplistic, failing to account for more nuanced aspects of real-time driving scenarios.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**

1. **Refinement of Interaction Dynamics**: Implement more sophisticated models for vehicle interaction dynamics that can dynamically adjust to varying traffic conditions. Consider employing differential equations that model the rate of change in vehicle positions and velocities with respect to time, providing a more continuous and fluid representation of traffic flow.

2. **Advanced Stochastic Models**: Enhance the model's capability to handle uncertainties by incorporating advanced stochastic differential equations. These can model the randomness in driver behavior and communication signals more accurately, improving the reliability of the decision-making process.

3. **Game Theory Enhancement**: Develop a more nuanced game-theoretical framework that includes a broader range of driver strategies and responses. This could involve the use of Nash Equilibrium models where each driver's strategy is optimal, given the strategies of others, providing a more realistic simulation of interactive driving scenarios.

4. **Improvement in Safety and Incentive Metrics**: Introduce more complex algorithms for calculating safety and incentives, possibly using integrals to assess the area under curves of speed and acceleration over time. This would provide a more comprehensive assessment of the potential impact of a lane change over a continuous time interval, leading to safer and more strategically sound decisions.

By focusing on these enhancements, the model can potentially achieve a more accurate and realistic simulation of driver behavior and vehicle interactions in lane-changing scenarios, leading to better decision-making and enhanced traffic flow and safety.

 To enhance the model's performance in automated vehicle lane-changing and traffic management, the following refined proposals are suggested:

1. **Integration of Advanced Mathematical Theories**: Incorporate differential equations and stochastic differential equations to model the dynamic and uncertain nature of vehicle interactions and driver behaviors more accurately. This approach will help in capturing the continuous changes in vehicle positions and velocities, as well as handling the randomness in driver decisions and communication signals.

2. **Enhancement of Game Theoretical Models**: Expand the game-theoretical framework to include a wider range of strategic interactions among drivers. Utilizing concepts like Nash Equilibrium in more complex scenarios will aid in better simulating competitive and cooperative behaviors, providing a realistic representation of traffic dynamics.

3. **Improvement of Interaction Dynamics**: Employ more sophisticated models for vehicle interaction dynamics that can dynamically adjust to different traffic conditions. This could involve using models that better account for the immediate effects of a vehicle's actions on its surrounding environment, thus improving the prediction accuracy of driver behaviors.

4. **Refinement of Safety and Incentive Metrics**: Develop algorithms that use integrals to calculate safety metrics and incentives over continuous time intervals. This method will allow for a more detailed assessment of the impacts of lane changes, leading to decisions that enhance both safety and traffic flow efficiency.

5. **Incorporation of Traditional Mathematical Methods**: Integrate classical mathematical or statistical methods, such as Bayesian inference or Markov processes, to improve the predictive power and accuracy of the model.

This decline suggests issues in the model's ability to accurately predict beneficial lane changes under the current formulation and settings.

### Analysis of Low Performance:

1. **Complexity in Interaction Modeling**: The model's complexity, particularly in handling dynamic vehicle interactions, may not capture the real-world intricacies of driving behaviors. This complexity could result in inaccurate predictions, especially in situations involving multiple simultaneous lane changes or dense traffic scenarios.

4. **Safety Criteria and Incentive Calculations**: The model's safety and incentive calculations might be overly simplistic or not reflective of real-time driving conditions. This could lead to either overly conservative or risky lane change decisions.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Refinement of Mathematical Models**: Implement differential equations that model the continuous dynamics of traffic flow, considering each vehicle's speed and acceleration over time. This approach can offer a more fluid representation of vehicle interactions.

2. **Enhanced Stochastic Models**: Integrate advanced stochastic differential equations to better model the uncertainties in driver behaviors and external conditions. This enhancement could improve the model's adaptability and decision-making accuracy under different traffic scenarios.

 The last trial of the MOBIL model (Iteration 5) resulted in a model loss increase to 0.744 from the baseline of 0.691, indicating a degradation in performance. This analysis identifies potential causes and suggests improvements.

### Analysis of Low Performance:
1. **Complexity and Realism in Modeling Dynamics**: The model utilizes IDM and MOBIL frameworks to predict vehicle behavior during lane changes. However, the simplifications in these models may not capture the full complexity of real-world driving dynamics, particularly under variable traffic conditions and driver behaviors.

2. **Handling of Stochastic Elements**: The integration of stochastic elements appears insufficient. Real-world driving involves significant randomness and variability, which may not be adequately represented in the current stochastic modeling approach.

3. **Safety and Incentive Calculations**: The calculations for safety and incentives might be overly simplistic. Real-time driving scenarios involve continuously changing variables that these static formulas may not accurately capture.

4. **Game Theoretical Limitations**: While the model attempts to incorporate game theory for simulating driver interactions, it may not effectively capture the range of human decision-making processes and their impact on traffic dynamics.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Refinement of Differential Equations**: Implement a system of differential equations that more accurately models the continuous dynamics of vehicles in traffic, taking into account acceleration, speed, and positional changes over time. This would help in capturing the fluid nature of traffic flow and driver responses more realistically.

2. **Advanced Stochastic Modeling**: Enhance the model's capability to handle uncertainties by integrating more sophisticated stochastic differential equations. These should better represent the variability and randomness in driver behavior and external conditions, improving decision-making under diverse scenarios.

3. **Complex Game Theory Framework**: Expand the game-theoretical aspects of the model to include a wider range of strategic interactions and adaptive behaviors. Incorporating concepts from evolutionary game theory could help simulate how drivers adapt their strategies based on past interactions and outcomes.

4. **Use of Integral Calculus for Safety Metrics**: Develop new safety and incentive metrics using integral calculus to assess the potential impacts of lane changes over continuous intervals. This approach could provide a more nuanced and comprehensive evaluation of the risks and benefits associated with different driving maneuvers.

By addressing these aspects, the model can achieve a higher degree of accuracy and reliability, better reflecting the complexities of real-world driving scenarios and enhancing overall traffic management and safety.

2. **Integration of Feedback Mechanisms**: Implement feedback loops that use real-world data to continuously update and refine the model's predictions. This could involve adjusting the courtesy coefficient based on observed outcomes of lane changes.
3. **Simplification of Complex Models**: Evaluate the current model's complexity and identify areas where simplifications could be made without significantly impacting performance. This might involve reducing the number of variables or assumptions in certain parts of the model.
4. **Exploration of New Mathematical Theories**: Investigate emerging mathematical theories that could enhance the model's performance, such as those involving adaptive behavior or more advanced stochastic processes.
5. **Comparative Analysis**: Conduct a comparative analysis with other non-machine learning models noted in recent research to identify effective strategies and potentially integrate successful elements into the existing framework.

 The analysis of the iteration logs reveals several factors contributing to the underperformance of the Improved MOBIL model compared to the baseline. Here��s a breakdown of the key issues and targeted suggestions for improvement:

### Key Issues:
1. **Complexity in Interaction Modeling**: The model attempts to account for complex vehicle interactions using IDM and MOBIL frameworks. However, it appears that the simplifications inherent in these models do not fully capture the nuanced dynamics of real-world driving, particularly under variable and dense traffic conditions.

2. **Stochastic Elements and Realism**: The stochastic modeling components are likely insufficient to handle the variability and randomness inherent in driver behavior and external traffic conditions. This shortfall may lead to predictions that are either too conservative or fail to anticipate realistic driver responses.

3. **Game Theoretical Framework**: While the integration of game theory aims to simulate strategic driver interactions, it may not effectively encompass the full spectrum of human decision-making, which can lead to suboptimal predictions regarding lane changes.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Enhanced Differential Equations**: Revise the differential equations to more accurately reflect continuous vehicle dynamics. This includes modeling acceleration, speed, and positional changes over time with more realistic assumptions about driver responses and vehicle interactions.

2. **Advanced Stochastic Processes**: Integrate more sophisticated stochastic differential equations that better capture the uncertainty and variability in driver behaviors and traffic conditions. This enhancement should focus on improving the model's adaptability to sudden changes in traffic flow and driver decisions.

3. **Refined Game Theory Application**: Expand the game-theoretical aspects to include more complex strategic interactions and adaptive behaviors. Consider using concepts from evolutionary game theory, which could allow the model to adapt based on historical data and outcomes, thereby improving predictive accuracy.

4. **Continuous Assessment with Integral Calculus**: Use integral calculus to develop new metrics for assessing the safety and benefits of lane changes over continuous intervals rather than at discrete points. This could lead to a more nuanced understanding of the impacts of lane changes, enhancing both safety and traffic flow efficiency.

By addressing these areas, the model can potentially achieve a higher level of accuracy and reliability, better reflecting the complexities of real-world driving scenarios and enhancing traffic management and safety.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: How have similar mathematical models been adapted or modified in recent scholarly or industrial research to tackle similar problems, and what can we learn from these adaptations?

4. **Integration of New Mathematical Techniques**: Are there emerging or less conventional mathematical techniques that could be integrated into our model to address its current shortcomings without resorting to machine learning methods?

5. **Interdisciplinary Approaches**: Can insights from fields outside of traditional computational areas, such as physics, biology, or economics, provide alternative mathematical frameworks or formulations that could be adapted to improve our model?

 ### Analysis of Low Performance:

The log analysis reveals that despite sophisticated modifications to the MOBIL model, performance has consistently declined across iterations, indicated by increased model loss and decreased F1 scores. Key reasons for this underperformance include:

1. **Complexity Overhead**: The introduction of complex mathematical formulations such as differential equations and stochastic models might have increased the model's sensitivity to minor variations in traffic data, leading to overfitting or misinterpretation of normal traffic variations as significant.

2. **Inadequate Handling of Stochastic Elements**: Traffic dynamics involve inherent randomness and variability. The current stochastic modeling might not sufficiently capture these elements, leading to predictions that do not align well with actual driver behaviors and traffic conditions.

3. **Safety and Incentive Calculations**: The safety and incentive calculations may be too rigid or simplistic, failing to capture the nuanced dynamics of real-time driving scenarios, where drivers react based on a multitude of observed and anticipated factors.

4. **Game Theory Limitations**: The application of game theory is intended to model the strategic interaction among drivers. However, the theoretical framework used may not adequately represent the complex decision-making processes involved in real-world driving, particularly under diverse and dynamic traffic conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement:

1. **Refinement of Differential Equations**: Simplify and refine the differential equations used in the model to focus on key variables that significantly impact driving decisions, such as relative speeds and distances, while reducing the emphasis on less impactful factors.

2. **Enhanced Stochastic Modeling**: Develop a more robust stochastic framework that better captures the probabilistic nature of traffic flow and driver behavior. This could involve modeling the distributions of key traffic parameters and incorporating these distributions into the decision-making process.

3. **Dynamic Safety and Incentive Metrics**: Introduce dynamic calculations for safety and incentives that adjust based on real-time data inputs rather than static formulas. This could involve using adaptive thresholds for safety and incentives that react to changes in traffic density and flow patterns.

4. **Advanced Game Theoretical Models**: Incorporate more advanced game-theoretical models that consider a wider range of human behaviors and strategies. This could include models from behavioral economics that account for irrational decision-making and risk preferences.

5. **Continuous Model Evaluation and Adaptation**: Implement a continuous learning loop where the model is regularly updated based on new traffic data and outcomes. This iterative process should focus on refining model assumptions and recalibrating parameters to better align with observed traffic behaviors and conditions.

By addressing these areas, the model can potentially achieve a higher level of reliability and accuracy, better reflecting the complexities of real-world driving scenarios and enhancing its utility in traffic management and vehicle automation systems.

3. **Comparative Analysis**: How do the mathematical formulations used in our model compare with those employed in other successful models in the same field? Are there lessons or techniques from these models that could be adapted or incorporated to enhance our model's performance?

4. **Integration of Non-Linear Dynamics**: Are there non-linear aspects of the phenomena being modeled that are currently not addressed or oversimplified in our mathematical approach? How can we better integrate non-linear dynamics into our model to enhance its predictive accuracy and robustness?

5. **Feedback Mechanisms and Iterative Refinement**: Could the incorporation of feedback mechanisms into the model improve its performance? What methods or approaches have others used to successfully integrate feedback into similar mathematical models?

2024-09-17 14:26:18,229 - research_agent_logger - INFO - Improve advice: 
 The analysis of the trial logs reveals a consistent decline in performance across iterations, despite sophisticated modifications to the MOBIL model. The performance degradation is evidenced by increased model loss and decreased F1 scores. Here are the identified issues and targeted suggestions for improvement:

### Identified Issues:
1. **Complexity Overhead**: The integration of complex mathematical formulations, such as differential equations and stochastic models, appears to increase the model's sensitivity to minor traffic variations, potentially leading to overfitting or misinterpretation of normal traffic variations as significant changes.
   
2. **Handling of Stochastic Elements**: The stochastic modeling components may not adequately capture the variability and randomness inherent in driver behavior and external traffic conditions, leading to predictions that do not align well with actual driver behaviors.

3. **Safety and Incentive Calculations**: The calculations for safety and incentives seem too rigid or simplistic, failing to capture the nuanced dynamics of real-time driving scenarios.

4. **Game Theory Limitations**: The theoretical framework used may not adequately represent the complex decision-making processes involved in real-world driving, especially under diverse and dynamic traffic conditions.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
1. **Simplification of Differential Equations**: Focus on key variables that significantly impact driving decisions, such as relative speeds and distances, while reducing the emphasis on less impactful factors. This could help in reducing the complexity and increasing the robustness of the model.

2. **Robust Stochastic Modeling**: Develop a more sophisticated stochastic framework that better captures the probabilistic nature of traffic flow and driver behavior. This could involve modeling the distributions of key traffic parameters and incorporating these distributions into the decision-making process.

3. **Dynamic Safety and Incentive Metrics**: Introduce dynamic calculations for safety and incentives that adjust based on real-time data inputs rather than static formulas. This could involve using adaptive thresholds for safety and incentives that react to changes in traffic density and flow patterns.

4. **Advanced Game Theoretical Models**: Incorporate more advanced game-theoretical models that consider a wider range of human behaviors and strategies. This could include models from behavioral economics that account for irrational decision-making and risk preferences.

5. **Continuous Model Evaluation and Adaptation**: Implement a continuous learning loop where the model is regularly updated based on new traffic data and outcomes. This iterative process should focus on refining model assumptions and recalibrating parameters to better align with observed traffic behaviors and conditions.

By addressing these areas, the model can potentially achieve a higher level of reliability and accuracy, better reflecting the complexities of real-world driving scenarios and enhancing its utility in traffic management and vehicle automation systems.

2024-09-17 14:26:52,094 - research_agent_logger - INFO - Idea: 
 To refine the proposed ideas for improving the lane change model, we should incorporate simplified yet robust stochastic models using genetic algorithms, develop dynamic safety and incentive metrics based on model-predictive control principles, integrate advanced game-theoretical models considering irrational behaviors, and establish a continuous model evaluation and adaptation system using methodologies that focus on real-time traffic dynamics. These strategies, inspired by successful case studies and recent advancements in traffic flow modeling, will address the identified issues and enhance the model's performance in real-world scenarios.

2024-09-17 14:27:41,954 - research_agent_logger - INFO - Success factors: 
 The substantial improvement in the lane change decision model's performance can be attributed to several key enhancements implemented in the Improved MOBIL model. Firstly, the refined model integrates advanced stochastic models and game-theoretical considerations, which better mimic real-world driver behaviors and interactions, leading to more realistic and effective decision-making strategies. 

Secondly, the use of genetic algorithms likely optimized the parameter selection, allowing for more precise control over the behavior of the model under varying traffic conditions. This optimization helps in fine-tuning the IDM and MOBIL parameters, thus enhancing the accuracy of the acceleration and safety calculations.

Thirdly, the incorporation of dynamic safety and incentive metrics based on model-predictive control principles ensures that the model not only evaluates the current traffic scenario but also predicts future conditions, leading to safer and more timely lane-changing decisions. This predictive capability is crucial in dynamic and dense traffic environments.

Lastly, the continuous model evaluation and adaptation system allows for real-time adjustments based on incoming traffic data, ensuring the model remains effective under changing traffic conditions. This adaptability is reflected in the significantly improved metrics: increased precision, recall, F1 score, and specificity, indicating enhanced overall performance and reliability of the model.
